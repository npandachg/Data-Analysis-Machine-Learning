This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

First Steps : Data Transformation. See : http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html
```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
flights
```
Filter selects rows (i.e match by values)
```{r}
Jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

```{r}
Jan1
```

Do multiple selection using %in% operator
```{r}
nov_dec <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
```
Some exercise
```{r}
arr2 <- filter(flights, arr_delay >= 2)
```
```{r}
houston <- filter(flights, dest == "HOU" )
```
```{r}
ua_aa_delta <- filter(flights, carrier %in% c("UA", "AA", "DL"))
```
```{r}
missing_dep <- filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))
```
Arrange data frame according to columns. Good for sorting
```{r}
most_delayed <- arrange(flights, arr_delay, dep_delay)
```

Select columns with select()
```{r}
# select by name
select(flights, year, month, day)
```

```{r}
# select by slice : all columns between year and day inclusive
select(flights, year:day)
```
```{r}
# helper functions to be used with select
select(flights, starts_with("m"))
```

```{r}
select(flights, c(starts_with("arr_"), starts_with("dep_")))
```
```{r}
flights_sml <- select(flights, year:day, ends_with("delay"),
                      distance, air_time)
```

Add new variables with mutate
```{r}
mutate(flights_sml, gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
       speed = distance/air_time*60)
```
Summarize collapses the data frame to a single row with the corresponding summary
```{r}
summarize(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Summarize is most useful when used with group_by to form grouped summaries.
```{r}
by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
summarize(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
Pipe using %>%
```{r}
delays <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter (count > 20, dest != "HNL")
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = delays, mapping = aes(x = dist, y = delay)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```
When summarizing by groups filter out the ones with small number of observations (n() less than 20 or so.)
